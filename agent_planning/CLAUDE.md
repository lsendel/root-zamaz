## 🚨 **Important Notes for Future Sessions**

### **Context Preservation**
This folder serves as a knowledge base for agent-driven development patterns. Each conversation should:
1. **Update this CLAUDE.md** with new insights and decisions
2. **Reference previous patterns** to maintain consistency
3. **Document new workflows** as they emerge
4. **Track success metrics** to validate approaches

### **Session Continuity**
When starting new sessions related to agent planning:
1. **Read this CLAUDE.md first** to understand previous context
2. **Review latest PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md** for current patterns
3. **Check ROUTINE_ANALYSIS_PROMPTS.md** for available tools
4. **Update documentation** with new insights

### **Cross-Project Application**
When applying these patterns to new projects:
1. **Start with PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md** to understand applicable patterns
2. **Use ROUTINE_ANALYSIS_PROMPTS.md** for regular improvement cycles
3. **Adapt patterns** to specific technology stacks and requirements
4. **Document variations** back to this knowledge base

**Remember**: The goal is to create a self-improving system where each project application teaches us how to do the next one better, faster, and more securely. This agent_planning folder is the memory and learning center for that continuous improvement process.
