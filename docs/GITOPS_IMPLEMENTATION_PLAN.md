      - License compliance check

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - Unit tests
      - Integration tests
      - E2E tests with Playwright
      - Coverage reports

  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [quality, test, security-scan]
    steps:
      - Build container images
      - Tag with commit SHA
      - Push to registry
      - Sign images

  deploy-staging:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    environment: staging
    steps:
      - Update staging manifests
      - ArgoCD sync staging
      - Run smoke tests

  deploy-production:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: deploy-staging
    environment: production
    steps:
      - Update production manifests
      - ArgoCD sync production
      - Monitor rollout
```

## Phase 3: Helm Charts Enhancement (Week 2-3)

### 4.3 Resource Management
- Define resource quotas
- Set up HPA and VPA
- Implement pod disruption budgets
- Configure cluster autoscaling

## Phase 5: Documentation and Training (Week 4)

### 5.1 Documentation
- Deployment procedures
- Rollback procedures
- Incident response playbooks
- Architecture diagrams
- Security policies

### 5.2 Runbooks
- Service deployment
- Monitoring and alerting
- Incident management
- Disaster recovery

## Implementation Timeline
- Week 1: Phases 1
- Week 2: Phases 2 and start of 3
- Week 3: Complete Phase 3 and start Phase 4
- Week 4: Complete Phase 4 and Phase 5

## Success Criteria
1. Zero-touch deployments to staging and production
2. Automated rollbacks on failure
3. Less than 5-minute recovery time for incidents
4. 99.9% deployment success rate
5. 100% automated security scanning coverage
6. Complete audit trail for all changes
