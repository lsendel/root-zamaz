   - Notify relevant stakeholders

4. **Resolution**
   - Deploy security fixes
   - Verify remediation
   - Update documentation
   - Publish security advisory

5. **Follow-up**
   - Post-incident review
   - Process improvements
   - Thank vulnerability reporter

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

- **Secure Coding Standards**
  - Follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines
  - Use static analysis tools (gosec, semgrep)
  - Implement input validation
  - Use prepared statements for database queries
  - Sanitize all user inputs

- **Code Review Requirements**
  - All code changes require review
  - Security-focused reviews for auth changes
  - Automated security scanning in CI/CD
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning

- **Testing Requirements**
  - Unit tests for security functions
  - Integration tests for auth flows
  - End-to-end security testing
  - Regular penetration testing

### For DevOps/Infrastructure

- **Container Security**
  - Use minimal base images
  - Scan images for vulnerabilities
  - Run containers as non-root
  - Implement resource limits

- **Network Security**
  - Use TLS 1.3 for all communication
  - Implement network segmentation
  - Configure firewalls properly
  - Monitor network traffic

- **Secrets Management**
  - Never commit secrets to version control
  - Use secure secret management tools
  - Rotate secrets regularly
  - Implement least privilege access

### For Users

- **Account Security**
  - Use strong, unique passwords
  - Enable multi-factor authentication
  - Regularly review account activity
