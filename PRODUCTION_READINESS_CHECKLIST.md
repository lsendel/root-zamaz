# Zero Trust Authentication MVP - Production Readiness Checklist

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive checklist and recommendations for deploying the Zero Trust Authentication MVP to production. Based on the code review and architecture analysis, here are the critical items to address before going live.

## üö® Critical Security Issues (MUST FIX)

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] **Fix user enumeration vulnerability** in login handler
  - Location: `pkg/handlers/auth.go:156-170`
  - Issue: Different error messages for invalid username vs password
  - Fix: Return generic "invalid credentials" message
  
- [ ] **Implement JWT key rotation**
  - Current: Static JWT secret
  - Required: Automatic key rotation every 30 days
  - Add backup keys for graceful transition

- [ ] **Fix session fixation vulnerability**
  - Location: `pkg/session/session.go`
  - Issue: Session ID not regenerated after login
  - Fix: Generate new session ID after successful authentication

- [ ] **Strengthen password validation**
  - Current: Only length validation
  - Required: Complexity rules, common password checking

### 2. Infrastructure Security
- [ ] **Network segmentation**
  - Implement Kubernetes Network Policies
  - Isolate database and Redis networks
  - Restrict egress traffic

- [ ] **Secrets management**
  - Migrate to external secrets (Vault/AWS Secrets Manager)
  - Remove hardcoded secrets from configuration
  - Implement secret rotation

- [ ] **Container security**
  - Run containers as non-root user
  - Use distroless base images
  - Implement pod security standards

## ‚ö° Performance & Reliability Issues

### 1. Database Optimization
- [ ] **Add missing indexes**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_email_active ON users(email) WHERE is_active = true;
  CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_audit_logs_user_created ON audit_logs(user_id, created_at);
  CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_device_attestations_user_status ON device_attestations(user_id, status);
  ```

- [ ] **Fix N+1 query problems**
  - Location: User roles/permissions loading
  - Solution: Implement eager loading with GORM preloading

- [ ] **Implement database connection pooling monitoring**
  - Add metrics for connection pool utilization
  - Set up alerts for connection exhaustion

### 2. Caching & Performance
- [ ] **Replace Redis KEYS with SCAN**

  - Add cache versioning
  - Implement cache warming strategies
  - Monitor cache hit rates

- [ ] **Fix race condition in session management**

- [ ] **Optimize middleware order**
  ```go
  // Optimal order:
  1. Recovery
  2. CORS
  3. Security headers
  4. Rate limiting
  5. Authentication
